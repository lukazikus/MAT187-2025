\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find an anti-derivative of  $\frac{1}{x^2 - 9}$ using partial fraction decomposition.
    \item Find an anti-derivative of  $\frac{1}{9 + x^2}$ using trig substitution.
    \item (\textbf{Challenge}) Find an anti-derivative of  $\frac{1}{9 + x^2}$ using partial fraction decomposition. Does your answer match the answer you got using trig substitution?

    \emph{Hint:} You may need to use complex numbers during your partial fraction decomposition step, but after simplifying, you should be left with a real answer.

    If a complex number $z=re^{i\theta}$, then $\ln z = \ln r + i\theta$.
\end{enumerate}

\item The magnitude of the force acting on a particle of charge $q_1$ that is $r$ meters away from another particle of charge $q_2$ is
   	\[
	  	F =k\frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}
   	\]
   	Suppose both $q_1$ and $q_2$ are positive, which means the two particles are being pushed away from each other (``opposites attract, likes repel''). Use integrals to answer the following.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The electrons start out at a distance of $10$m.
        The charge of the electrons is $q_1=q_2=1.6\cdot 10^{-19}$.

        How much work is required to move the electrons so that they
        are only $1m$ apart?
        
        \emph{Hint:} The work is done \textit{against} the force field and therefore is given by the integral of $-F(r)$ over distance from $r=a$ to $r=b$.%(work done against a force over a distance is $\int_a^b F(r) \,  dr$)
        \item Is it possible to move the electrons so that they are $0$ meters apart?
        \item If the electrons started very, very far away, would it be possible to bring them into a distance of $1m$ from each other with a 
        finite amount of work?
    \end{enumerate}

\item The usual definition of the Gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ is in terms of an improper integral: 
\[
        \Gamma(x) = \int_0^\infty e^{-t}t^{x-1}\,\mathrm dt.
    \]

In the last tutorial, you showed that $\Gamma(n)=n\Gamma(n-1)$, which means if $\Gamma(1)=1$, the function $\Gamma(x)$ will have a finite value for integers $x\geq 1$.


The topic of this question is to prove that this integral converges for any $x\geq0$. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Directly compute $\Gamma(1)$ from the integral definition of $\Gamma$.

    \item Consider the integrand $g_x(t)=e^{-t}t^{x-1}$.
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For which values of $x$ does $g_x$ have a vertical asymptote? For which values of $x$ does $g_x$ have a horizontal asymptote?
        For which values of $x$ is $g_x$ a non-negative function?
        \item Show that if $t\geq 1$, then $g_{x_1}(t) \geq g_{x_2}(t)$ so
        long as $x_1\geq x_2\geq 1$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item We know that $\Gamma(n) = (n+1)!$, and so $\Gamma$ at any integer is
     \emph{finite}. Using this fact, apply a comparison test to show that
      $\Gamma(x)<\infty$ when $x\geq1$.

      \emph{Hint:} You may need to do separate comparisons for $t<1$ and $t\geq 1$.
    
    \item Let's show that $\Gamma(x)$ converges for $0<x<1$. Split up $\Gamma(x)$ into the following two integrals:

    \[\Gamma(x) = \Gamma_1(x) + \Gamma_2(x) = \int_0^1 e^{-t}t^{x-1}\mathrm dt + \int_1^\infty e^{-t}t^{x-1}\mathrm dt\]

    If both $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ converge, then we're good!

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Show that $e^{-t}t^{x-1} \leq t^{x-1}$ and then 
        use a comparison test to show that $\Gamma_1(x)$ converges. 
        \item Show that $e^{-t}t^{x-1} \leq e^{-t}$ and then use a comparison test to show $\Gamma_2(x)$ converges.
    \end{enumerate}

    
\end{enumerate}



\end{enumerate}
