\subsection*{Learning Objectives}
	Students need to be able to\ldots
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Manipulate series by shifting indices.
        \item Work with geometric series and their applications.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection*{What to Do}
	Introduce the learning objectives for the day's tutorial.
	Continue as usual, walking around the room and asking questions while letting students work on the next problem and gathering them together for discussion when most groups have finished.
    
    Seven minutes before class ends, pick a suitable problem to do as a wrap-up. Most likely, \#3 or \#4 will be a good choice.
	
\subsection*{Notes}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Hopefully this problem won't be hard for them. The only tricky part may be understanding how to shift indices, but if you get them to write out a few terms, they should be able to see how they should modify the index within the summation.
