    \item Understand phase line plots.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Context}

\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item This question should be a good warmup to the tutorial. It emphasizes that not all linear ODEs are separable and not all separable ODEs are linear. 
    \item This question should be a gentle introduction to interpreting phase line plots. Ensure that students understand that the phase line plot is not a plot of $y$ vs. $t$, but it is a plot of $y'$ vs. $y$.
    \item This question is about translating a word description into an ODE. Students should identify keywords such as "rate proportional", "limits", and "time progresses" to help them choose which ODE is most appropriate.
