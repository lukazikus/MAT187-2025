\subsection*{Learning Objectives}
Students need to be able to\ldots
\begin{itemize}
	\item Evaluate improper integrals.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Notes}
	\begin{enumerate}
			\item The first two parts should be fairly standard by applying the standard trigonometric substitution and partial fraction techniques. The third part can be quite challenging since it involves manipulating the inverse tangent function using triangles and realizing that the constant of integration can include a separate term.

            \item This question should be straightforward if the students follow the instructions in the questions. They may need some guidance on what it means for the electrons to be far apart.

            \item This question mainly involves applying integration by parts once - the difficult part is the abstraction, with multiple variables involved. Clarifying which variables are constant with respect to other operations is important, and they may need some help with that. 

            \item The students dont have to get through this question.
