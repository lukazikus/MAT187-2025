\subsection*{Learning Objectives}
Students need to be able to\ldots
\begin{itemize}
	\item Evaluate improper integrals.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Notes}
	\begin{enumerate}
			\item The first two parts should be fairly standard by applying the standard trigonometric substitution and partial fraction techniques. The third part can be quite challenging since it involves manipulating the inverse tangent function using triangles and realizing that the constant of integration can include a separate term.

            \item This question should be straightforward if the students follow the instructions in the questions. They may need some guidance on what it means for the electrons to be far apart.
