\subsection*{Learning Objectives}
Students need to be able to solve separable and first-order linear ODEs, understand integrating factors, and determine equilibrium points from phase plots.


\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    \item Here are a few standard ODEs for the students to get comfortable applying the solving techniques presented in lecture.
\end{enumerate}
