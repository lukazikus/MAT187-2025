\subsection*{Learning Objectives}
Students need to be able to solve separable and first-order linear ODEs, understand integrating factors, and determine equilibrium points from phase plots.


\subsection*{Notes}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Students may think there is only one integrating factor at first by just plugging into the standard integral formula. However, they should realize that this antiderivative is not unique, and because of the added constant term that is exponentiated, there are infinite valid integrating factors.
    \item If the students struggle with classifying equilibrium points, you can try to help explain the concept visually with as the flow of a river, and dropping a blob of ink into the river and seeing where it would go. Stable equilibria concentrate at a point, where as semistable will spill out on one edge, and unstable equilibria will push the ink outwards in both directions.
    \item Here are a few standard ODEs for the students to get comfortable applying the solving techniques presented in lecture.
    \item This is a challenging question that will require many steps. First, students will need to reduce the given ODE to a first order one, solve it, and then extract the original solution.
\end{enumerate}
