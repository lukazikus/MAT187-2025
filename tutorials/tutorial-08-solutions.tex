\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    $y=1$ is semistable,
    $y=2$ is stable,
    $y=3$ is unstable
    
    A visual argument (``If we are just below 1, the derivative is positive, so it's going back to 1'') is nicer than an abstract argument that seems memorized (``If the phase plot crosses from top left to bottom right, it is stable'')

    \item 
    At $y=2.8$, the derivative is negative. The function will decrease. It will continue to do so until $y$ is getting close to 2. The limit will be 2.
\end{enumerate}
