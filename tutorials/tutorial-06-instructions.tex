\subsection*{Notes}
	\begin{enumerate}
    \item This should be a straightforward question. 
    \item Note: (iv) is a straight diagonal line. All others are paths on the circle, with different speeds and domains for the angles. Students will have to relate the speed (the coefficient on $t$) and the size of the domain to the graphical drawing.
    \item They may struggle knowing what the equation for the tangent line is or what the tangent line is conceptually. They need to write down a formula for the line.
